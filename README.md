# Bel'veth Ult Passive

### Instructions

Bel'veth, currently, is a new League of Legends champion with an <i>interesting</i> passive on her ultimate. Every 2 `hits`, Bel'veth does a burst of true damage to her target. However, each burst increases the damage of the next burst by the amount that was just dealt, stacking infinitely. The `baseDmg` is also increased by 0.12% for each point in `bonusAD` (12% per 100 `bonusAD`).
<break/>

Create a function that accepts `baseDmg`, `hits`, and `bonusAD` as parameters and returns the total damage her passive would do, based on the amount of `hits`.

### Tips

`bonusAD` isn't required and the function should work without it.
<break/>

Answers should be rounded to the nearest decimal point (If it has one).
